    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <p>The reserved characters used in HTML documents are known as HTML entities. They are not seen on the typical keyboard. They provide a wide range of characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, 
    mathematical operators, and so on.</p>
    <p>HTML entities are useful when you want to display special characters that may conflict with HTML syntax or when you want to ensure proper rendering across different platforms and browsers that may have different character encoding settings.</p>

    <p><b>The two main purposes of HTML entities are:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Displaying Special Character.</b></li>
            <li><b>Handling Reserved Character.</b></li>
        </ol>
