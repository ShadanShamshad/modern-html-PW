        <li style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>Use a CMS that supports accessibility:</strong></li>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">When building a website, choose a content management system (CMS) that supports web accessibility. Be sure that page layouts, themes, widgets, plugins, and other aspects are compatible with web accessibility standards</p>
        <li style="font-size: 30px;"><strong> Use tables for tabular data</strong></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">When tables are used for page layout purposes, users that rely on screen readers can face extra difficulties in understanding the content. This is due to the fact that the content may be read in a way that does not match the visual order of the page. As an alternative, use a CSS presentation, not a table, to structure the layout of a web page.</p>
        <li style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>Use colors carefully</strong></li>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Colors can help your users easily distinguish different sets of information. However, color blindness and other disabilities can make it difficult for users to find information, call-to-action buttons, or other aspects when developers fail to maintain a proper contrast of colors. To check the contrast of colors on your site, add the Google Chrome extension</p>
